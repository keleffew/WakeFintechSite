## The purpose of this club

1. **Industry Connection**

We actively engage leading firms outside of the classroom. We have spent the last three years developing personal relationships with employees at Fortune 500 companies as well as leading, high growth start-ups. We actively contribute to open-source code, claim bounties in exchange for crypto, and perform high level analysis of projects in the bleeding-edge of the Financial-Technology sector on our blog.

2. **The Transformation of Banking**

How has the concept of a 'bank' shifted over the past decade? Is Venmo a bank? How has digital fund transfer changed the industry? – These topics and more will be covered.

3. **Develop Technical Skills**

We aim to be the first club to take advantage of the 'Wake Forest Innovation Quarter' and utilize all that it has to offer. Workshops will be hosted to help students learn systems integration, hardware, and software as related to Fintech applications.

4. **Algorithmic Trading**

Learn how high-frequency trading (HFT) has disrupted the investment banking industry by leveraging computative power and deep learning algorythms. We will cover how to write Python scripts to perform quant trades and go over key algorithms and models – including 'Black-Scholes' and more.

5. **Blockchain**

A blockchain is a cryptographically verified ledger distributed to all active participants in a network. As a result of cryptography and the 'network effect' it is hacker proof. The blockchain is a key concept related to Fintech and has many applications in the realm of IOT, smart-contracts, and digital conflict resolution.  We actively study core blockchain concepts so that students will be prepared for careers in cutting-edge financial technology.

6. **Cryptocurrencies and Tokens**

We will address the theory behind how cryptocurrencies and smart-contract tokens work as well as how they are being implemented across the web. Domestic and international regulatory schemes will be covered - with an emphasis on core precedent such as the Howey Test.  Meaningful use cases within the real world will be covered as well.
